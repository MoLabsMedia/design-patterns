## WORKFLOW

generally `top-down approach`

1. set list of final result `what it can and will possibly do?`
2. choose `proper language(s)` to achieve the results
  - maintenence-wise
  - performance-wise
  - interface-friendliness-wise
  - ease-of-use-wise
  - ...
3. choose proper `design patterns` for different modules
  - maintenence
  - expansion
  - flexibility
  - security
  - ease-of-use
4. choose proper `algorithms` for core, performance-sensitive, and computational-condensed modules
5. finish codes
6. progressive `testing` ( unit testing, AB testing ... ) and `refactoring` or `alternative modules`
7. user testing
8. improvements
