## WORKFLOW

generally `bottom-up approach`

1. break the whole thing into 'parts/modules' at different levels
2. learn mechanisms of these 'parts/modules' at different levels
3. break the 'parts/modules' into smallest possible pieces
4. study these pieces, categorize these pieces according to their functions
5. try to assemble these pieces into bigger 'parts/modules'
6. try to assemble 'parts/modules' into the whole thing
7. try to assemble these pieces into other bigger 'parts/modules' and assemble those 'parts/modules' into something else
